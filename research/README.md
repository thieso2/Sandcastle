# Container Isolation Technology Research

**Date:** February 13, 2026
**Purpose:** Evaluate alternatives to Docker + Sysbox for Sandcastle sandboxes
**Related Issue:** [#17 - Research: Firecracker microVM as Docker alternative](https://github.com/thieso2/Sandcastle/issues/17)

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: Keep Docker + Sysbox**

All evaluated alternatives have critical blockers that make them unsuitable for Sandcastle's Docker-in-Docker use case with persistent workspaces and dynamic networking.

| Technology | Status | Critical Blocker |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| **Docker + Sysbox** | ✅ Current solution | None |
| **Firecracker** | ❌ Not viable | No filesystem sharing support |
| **Flintlock** | ❌ Not viable | No nested virtualization support |
| **gVisor** | ❌ Not viable | Docker-in-Docker is ephemeral only |
| **Kata Containers** | ⚠️ Unsuitable | 2-4x slower Docker-in-Docker |

## Quick Reference Tables

### Requirements Matrix

| Requirement | Sysbox | Firecracker | Flintlock | gVisor | Kata |
|------------|--------|-------------|-----------|--------|------|
| Docker-in-Docker | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Bind Mounts | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| Dynamic Networking | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| Port Binding | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Snapshots | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Security | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| API Maturity | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Performance | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |
| Ops Complexity | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ |

**Legend:** ✅ Good | ⚠️ Issues | ❌ Critical blocker

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | Sysbox | Firecracker | gVisor | Kata |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|------|
| Boot Time | 2-5s | 125ms ✅ | 2-5s | 125-500ms |
| Memory/Container | 10-50MB | <5MB ✅ | 10-50MB | 15-30MB |
| CPU Overhead | ~1% ✅ | ~5% | ~10% | ~5-10% |
| Docker Build Speed | Baseline ✅ | N/A | Slower | 2-4x slower ❌ |

### Security Comparison

**Isolation Strength** (weakest → strongest):
1. Docker (vanilla runc)
2. **Docker + Sysbox** ← Current
3. gVisor
4. Kata Containers
5. Firecracker

**Verdict:** Sysbox provides sufficient isolation for Sandcastle's use case (developer sandboxes, trusted-but-isolated users)

## Key Findings

### Why Docker + Sysbox Wins

1. **Only solution optimized for Docker-in-Docker**
   - Persistent workspaces (`/workspace` volumes)
   - Near-native performance
   - Full Docker API support

2. **Works everywhere Docker works**
   - No nested virtualization required
   - Compatible with cloud VMs
   - Runs inside Docker containers (Rails app)

3. **Production-proven for 2+ years**
   - Stable operation
   - Known operational model
   - Docker corporate backing

4. **Dynamic networking support**
   - Tailscale per-user bridges
   - WeTTY ephemeral sidecars
   - Connect/disconnect at runtime

### Why Alternatives Don't Work

**Firecracker:**
- ❌ No virtio-fs or 9p filesystem sharing
- ❌ Cannot bind-mount `/data/users/{name}/home`
- ❌ No hot-plug networking (breaks Tailscale/WeTTY UX)

**Flintlock:**
- ❌ Firecracker can't run inside Docker (where Rails lives)
- ❌ Would require architectural redesign
- ⚠️ Community-led, inconsistent releases

**gVisor:**
- ❌ Docker-in-Docker requires tmpfs-only overlay
- ❌ All container changes are ephemeral (lost on restart)
- ❌ Breaks persistent workspace model

**Kata Containers:**
- ❌ Docker builds are 2-4x slower
- ❌ Image pulls are 2-3x slower
- ⚠️ Requires nested virtualization
- ⚠️ 40-50% I/O degradation on bind mounts

## Recommendations

### Short-Term (Next 6 months)
✅ **Keep Docker + Sysbox**
- No viable alternatives exist
- Migration risk outweighs uncertain benefits
- Current solution works well in production

### Medium-Term (6-18 months)
🔍 **Monitor for improvements:**
- Firecracker: filesystem sharing, hot-plug networking
- Kata: Docker-in-Docker performance optimizations
- gVisor: persistent overlay support

### Long-Term (18+ months)
🔮 **Consider hybrid approach:**
- Standard tier: Docker + Sysbox (default, $10/month)
- High-security tier: Kata/Firecracker (opt-in, $25/month)
- Requires container service abstraction layer (Issue #17 Phase 1)

## Research Methodology

### Approach
1. **Parallel research agents** — 5 specialized agents ran concurrently
2. **Sandcastle-specific focus** — Evaluated against actual requirements
3. **Production reality** — Considered operational complexity, not just features
4. **No assumptions** — Deep research from official docs, benchmarks, production use cases

### Evaluation Criteria

- ✅ Persistent bind mounts (CRITICAL)
- ✅ Dynamic networking (HIGH)
- ✅ Port binding and SSH (CRITICAL)
- ✅ Snapshots/restore (HIGH)
- ✅ Security isolation (HIGH)
- ✅ API maturity (HIGH)
- ✅ Performance (MEDIUM)
- ✅ Operational complexity (MEDIUM)
- ✅ Production readiness (HIGH)
- ✅ Deployment flexibility (MEDIUM)

### Sources

- GitHub repositories and issue trackers
- Production deployment case studies
- Performance benchmarks from independent sources
- Security advisories and CVE databases
- Community discussions and expert blogs

## How to Use This Research

### For Decision-Making
1. Read [COMPARISON.md](./COMPARISON.md) executive summary
2. Review requirements matrix and decision tree
3. Check individual technology reports for details
4. Use decision matrix to evaluate future alternatives

### For Implementation Planning
- If staying with Sysbox: Document limitations in ops runbook
- If considering alternatives: Review implementation complexity sections
- If building abstraction layer: Use requirements matrix as interface spec

### For Future Re-evaluation
- Monitor technology improvements (listed in recommendations)
- Watch for CVEs affecting Sysbox or user namespaces
- Track Docker's Sysbox maintenance commitment
- Reassess when compliance requirements change
