add sandcastle go cli (vendor/sandcastle-cli) to my homebrew-tap repo so i can install it using brew install thieso2/tap/sandcastle

---

add -v --version to the cli to print the version (currently v0.1.14 - should be auto-generated)

---

hwo is the version updated? my suggestion would be to create a mise task release or release:patch
