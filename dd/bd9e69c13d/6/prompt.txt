use flash messages instead of toast

---

dashboard: "Start and stop" do no updated the sandcastle controls. Shold show "staring/stoppin/destoing" instead of buttons and reload the partial once done.
destroy shows a dialog but does not destroy the castle.
check in chrome!

"stopping" does not terminate - does the background job return work?

---

start/stop are fin - destroy does not destroy! trace the code!

---

also destry should not use a confirm dialog that covers the screen. just replace the buttons with "destoy: are you sure y/n". that ways the screen stays visible

---

no browser consone log. action is not triggered.

---

destoy doesnt do anything. logg says:
