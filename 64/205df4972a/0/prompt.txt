https://demo.sandcastle.rocks is missing the login with Github button - why?

---

hwop to setup the app on GH?

---

the GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET need to be trandferred from sanmcastle.env to .env on inbstall - also add then the the empty env on gen-env

---

commit this

---

installer.sh update needs to add the SECRETS to .env

---

push it

---

GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET GITHUB_CLIENT_ID are in .env but the GH logn is not shown on sandman - debug!

---

update rewrite the compose

---

for the admin add setting screen for social login: to connect GH and Google for login. create a settings table to store 
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
encrypt the secret fields. do not show the secrets in the ui and allow to set them.
